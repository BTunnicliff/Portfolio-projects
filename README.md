# Portfolio-projects

This repository contains all of my data analytics portfolio projects, I am using it as a way of demonstrating the technical skills that I have developed.

For a brief summary of each project:

### Data Cleaning - Nashville Housing
* Uses SQL queries to demonstrate data cleaning skills.
* Files included are the original dataset, the cleaned version of the dataset, and the SQL queries used to clean the data.

### Exploratory data analysis - COVID-19 data
* Demonstrates knowledge of SQL, providing queries for a quick analysis of COVID-19 data.
* Files included are the original data, split into two .csv files, as well as the SQL code that I wrote.

### Cyclistic case study
* Capstone project for the Google data analytics certificate.
* Measured differences in behaviour for casual users and members of a fictional bike ride-share service.
* Made reccomendations to convert casual users into members, based on the findings of the analysis.
* Files included are the R script that I wrote to create a .csv file containing all of the data, an R script to analyse and visualise the data, and a final .md report demonstrating the final findings and reccoendations from the analysis. Unfortunately the full .csv file was too large to upload.
