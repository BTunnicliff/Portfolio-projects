# Exploratory data analysis with COVID-19 data.

This was a project that I did in an attempt to demonstrate my SQL skills. It uses worldwide COVID-19 data up to early May 2021, it is sourced from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
The data was split into two files so I could practice joins.

While I am happy with this project I still think that I have a lot to improve on related to SQL.
