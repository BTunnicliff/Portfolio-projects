# Cyclistic Case Study

### tl;dr
* Case study for a fictional bike-share company wanting to find ways to convert casual users into subscribers/members.
* I used R to collect, clean and analyse the data.
* Notable findings included casual riders using the service more on weekends, and a significant increase in usage during the Summer months.
* Reccomended actions included possibly discounting membership fees during Summer months, as well as placing advertisements at stations that casual riders use frequently.

This case study has been completed as my capstone project for the Google data analytics certificate.

In this project I have analysed data and presented insights for Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company based in Chicago, Illinois.

While I do believe that the project went reasonably well, there were a few things that I think I could have improved on, including:

* Finding more simple/less time consuming solutions to things. For example when checking to see if the structure of each dataset was the same there may have been a function to check if each str() output matched, rather than checking each individual output.
* General report presentation. I felt that some of the sections of the report looked quite messy, especially the processing and cleaning sections, I think I could improve this by either making the code more tidy, or leaving some of it out of the report.
* I also think that I could improve on data cleaning and processing, as that is where I had the most issues.
