# Cyclistic Case Study

### tl;dr
* Case study for a fictional bike-share company wanting to find ways to convert casual users into subscribers/members.
* I used R to collect, clean and analyse the data.
* Notable findings included casual riders using the service more on weekends, and a significant increase in usage during the Summer months. It was also found that casual riders seem to use the service for leisure, while members seem to use it for commuting
* Reccomended actions included possibly discounting membership fees during Summer months, as well as placing advertisements at stations that casual riders use frequently. Other possible actions could include weekend membership sales, as well as using targeted advertising to convert frequent casual users into memebrs who use the service for commuting etc.

This case study has been completed as my capstone project for the Google data analytics certificate.

In this project I have analysed data and presented insights for Cyclistic, a fictional bike share company based in Chicago, Illinois.



While I do believe that the project went reasonably well, there were a few things that I think I could have improved on, including:

* General report presentation. I felt that some of the sections of the report looked quite messy, especially the processing and cleaning sections, I think I could improve this by either making the code more tidy, or leaving some of it out of the report.
* I think that I still need to work on learning more about R so that I can have an easier time solving problems that may come up.
